# Overview


a simple program that takes input and renames files within your computer

so I had written this program in python but I lost that program so I remade it in go.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I made this using the text editor vscode

librarys:
"fmt" provide formatting, 
"os" handles operating system interactions, 
"path/filepath" manipulates file paths for Go programs.

# Future Work

- add partial renaming/replacing characters
- add option to change file extension
